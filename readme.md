# Movie Data Parser

## Overview

The Movie Data Parser is a Python script designed to scrape data from Kinopoisk's top 1000 movie list. It uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup for web scraping and allows you to gather information on the top-rated movies, including their name, rating, year of release, country of origin, producer, and availability on Kinopoisk.

## Features

The Movie Data Parser offers the following functionality:

1. Automated web scraping of Kinopoisk's top 1000 movie list.
2. Extraction of movie details, including name, rating, year, country, producer, and availability on Kinopoisk.
3. Utilizes random User-Agent strings for anonymity.
4. Supports headless mode for running without a visible browser.
5. Configurable delays to avoid overloading the website.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Movie Data Parser, you will need to install the required dependencies and set up a Python environment. The following technologies are used in this project:

## Technologies

- Python
- Selenium
- Beautiful Soup
- Webdriver Manager
- Fake User-Agent

## Usage

1. Install Python on your system if it's not already installed.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-data-parser.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-data-parser
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python movie_data_parser.py
   ```

6. The parsed movie data will be saved to a JSON file named "top1000.json."

## Possible Improvements

1. Implement multi-threading or asynchronous requests for faster data retrieval without increasing time.sleep delays.

2. Add a command-line interface to accept user input for customizing the scraping parameters.

3. Enhance data validation and error handling for improved reliability.

4. Store data in a more structured format, such as a database, for better organization and analysis.

5. Expand the scraping capabilities to include additional movie details, such as cast and plot summaries.
